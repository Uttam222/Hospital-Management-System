# 🏥 Hospital Management System

A full-stack hospital appointment management system that allows patients to book appointments and enables admins to review, approve, or reject them with built-in conflict prevention and dynamic availability handling.

This project is designed to simulate a real-world healthcare workflow, focusing on clean architecture, role-based access, and data integrity rather than just UI.

## 📂 Repositories

- 🔗 **Frontend:** [hospital-react-client](https://github.com/Uttam222/Hospital-react-client)  
- 🔗 **Backend:** [hospital-server](https://github.com/Uttam222/hospital-server)

## ✨ Key Features

### 👤 Patient Side
- Book hospital appointments through a simple React interface
- Automatic validation for required fields
- Smart handling of unavailable dates with next available date suggestions
- Appointments are created in a pending state by default

### 🛠 Admin Side
- Secure admin login using JWT authentication
- View all appointments in a centralized dashboard
- Approve or reject appointments
- Prevents approving conflicting appointments for the same doctor and date
- Only approved appointments block availability

### 🧠 Smart Logic
- Dynamic availability (no hardcoded schedules)
- Date conflicts are calculated from existing approved appointments
- Rejected appointments do not block future bookings
- Clean separation between business logic and UI

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React
- React Router
- Fetch API
- Modern component-based UI structure

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- RESTful API design

### Database
- MongoDB (Appointments, Doctors, Admin logic)

## 🏗 Project Architecture

This project is split into three repositories for clarity and scalability:

- 🔹 **Main Repository (This Repo)**  
  Acts as the project overview and documentation hub, linking the frontend and backend while explaining the system design.

- 🔹 **Frontend Repository**  
  📁 `hospital-react-client`  
  Handles all UI logic, form validation, admin dashboard, and API interactions.

- 🔹 **Backend Repository**  
  📁 `hospital-server`  
  Implements REST APIs, authentication, appointment logic, admin controls, and database operations.

## 🔐 Security & Access Control

- JWT-based authentication for admin routes
- Protected API endpoints using middleware
- Admin-only privileges enforced on the backend
- Frontend access alone cannot bypass backend authorization

## 📌 Appointment Flow (High Level)

1. Patient submits appointment request  
2. Appointment is stored as pending  
3. Admin reviews the request  
4. Admin approves or rejects  
5. Only approved appointments block a doctor’s date  
6. Conflicting approvals are prevented automatically

## 🚀 Why This Project Matters

This project goes beyond CRUD:

- Demonstrates real-world backend decision logic
- Shows understanding of auth, roles, and data consistency
- Built with scalability and clarity in mind
- Structured like a production-ready system, not a demo app
